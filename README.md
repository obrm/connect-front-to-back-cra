# Connect Front to Back - MERN Stack Project

This repository contains a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack project that demonstrates how to connect a front-end React application to a back-end Node/Express API. It can serve as a boilerplate project for a MERN stack application, providing a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications. 
The project is based on the following tutorial I wrote: [Setting up a Full Stack React & Node.js Project: A Comprehensive Cheat Sheet.](https://medium.com/@obrm770/setting-up-a-full-stack-react-node-js-project-a-comprehensive-cheat-sheet-ee326576c21a)

#### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v14.x or later)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (v7.x or later)
* [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) (v1.x or later)

#### Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obrm/connect-front-to-back.git
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a config.env file in the config directory:

```bash
cd config
touch config.env
```  
4. Add the following lines to your config.env file:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
```

6. Navigate to the client directory:
```bash
cd ..
cd client
```
7. Install the necessary dependencies[^1]:
```bash
yarn
```

#### Running the Application

To run the application, in the root directory, start the Node/Express server and the react application concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000` and the React CRA application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

Now you have both the front-end and back-end servers running. You can interact with the application through the browser on `http://localhost:3000` and see how the front-end React app communicates with the back-end Node/Express API.
